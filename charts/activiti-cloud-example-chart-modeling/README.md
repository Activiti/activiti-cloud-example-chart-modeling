# An example chart for an Activiti Cloud Application

An example that includes all the basic components of an Activiti cloud application. If you have DNS available then to get started:

1) Copy the values.yaml from here to activitivalues.yaml.
2) Find-replace `activiti.envalfresco.com` with a DNS or IP address for your cluster. You should have this from when the cluster was set up or from running apps. For example, on a jenkns-X cluster first do `jx env dev` and then `jx get urls`. Youâ€™ll see url of the form http://jenkins.jx.<SPECIFIC_TO_YOUR_CLUSTER>.
3) Do `helm repo add activiti-cloud-charts https://activiti.github.io/activiti-cloud-charts/`
4) Run `helm install -f activitivalues.yaml activiti-cloud-full-example`

If you don't have DNS then remove the Ingresses and instead set the Services to type LoadBalancer. Deploy to find out the IPs and then update the values.yaml after you've found out the IPs (from kubectl get services) and update the helm release with `helm upgrade`.

There is a flag in the values.yaml to enable a demo ui if desired and commented sections that can be uncommented to enable security policies.

You can use a postman collection to explore the example. Download https://github.com/Activiti/activiti-cloud-examples/blob/master/Activiti%20v7%20REST%20API.postman_collection.json and import the collection into your postman (we recommend installing the app and not using the chrome one). Set the value of the gateway to http://activiti-cloud-gateway.<SPECIFIC_TO_YOUR_CLUSTER> and idm to http://activiti-keycloak.<SPECIFIC_TO_YOUR_CLUSTER>

Call the refresh endpoint in gateway to refresh it.
Call the getKeycloakToken endpoint to get a keycloak token.
Call startProcess to start a process instance.
Call queryProcessInstances in query to check that query can see the process instance. Call getEvents in audit to check that the event was audited. You should also see this process instance in the UI that you checked in iv.

The example is a starting-point - plug in your images if you have them and add further runtime-bundles and connectors to customise.

To enable postgres rather than h2 set db.deployPostgres. See individual charts for more options.
